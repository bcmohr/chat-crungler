# chat-crungler

The Chat Crungler is a horribly written piece of tkinter and ttkbootstrap code. It allows for the user to edit and submit full chat converstaions to a Large Language Model using the OpenAI python library.

Personally, I use it to interface with a locally-running LLM server. One good example would be LMStudio, another might be llama-cpp-python.

Good luck.
